<table><tbody><tr><td width="683">During these uncertain times we appreciate that everyone has a lot to think about, but we would like to thank you for your continued support, and give an update on how COVID-19 (coronavirus) is impacting Meal-a-Day’s projects and the actions that we are taking and have &nbsp;taken.<p></p><p>Meal-a-Day’s mission is, ”as a practical witness to our faith, to share the blessings we receive from God to help those in real need in the less developed parts of the world”. With so much happening much closer to home here in the UK, it’s easy to forget that the coronavirus pandemic is global, and impacts are being felt across the world, including the countries in which Meal-a-Day operates. We recognise that many people in the UK are being adversely impacted in many ways, but we have been asked by a number of our supporters for an update on how our projects are affected, so we wanted to share some of this with you.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Whilst the number of cases across Africa are currently very low, there is significant concern that when the virus spreads, many people living in rural areas and the poorest urban areas (places where we typically operate) will not have access to the sanitation, hygiene and health services required to stem the spread. Up to three quarters of people living in rural parts of these countries do not have the facilities at home to wash their hands, and a ‘lockdown’ quarantine in these areas is very difficult, because people cannot stock up, but rather they live hand to mouth.</p>
<p>We have already taken action across all of the projects we support to help to protect the children from the virus to a good extent, but it falls well short of the standards we see in the UK. Below you will see a brief update from a number of our core projects, so you can get a glimpse of how the projects have been impacted, how the children are being protected and what we are doing in very difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>In times like this, our only source of help is The Lord. Please join us in praying for the world during these uncertain times, and for the return of Jesus.</p>
<p>May God bless you and keep you safe.</p>

<h1>Updates from our Core Projects</h1>
<p><strong>Timboni Tiva Children’s Home – Eastern Kenya</strong></p>
<p>The Kenyan government originally instructed that all ‘Institutions’ should close (this was in March) and this applies to Timboni. There was an exception for true orphans who had no family whatsoever and nowhere to go. Around three academic years have now returned to school, and the corresponding children are returning to the home.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lela Children’s Home, Kamukuywa – Western Kenya</strong></p>
<p>Local schools are closed and 28 children have left to go and stay with guardians, but 43 children remain.</p>
<p>Those children who have remained either have no relatives to go to or some have actually been adopted or are formally fostered by Justus and Annette, who run the project. (<a href="https://vimeo.com/354337997?ref=em-share">see our Lela 2019 film</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/354337997?ref=em-share">here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Crown City School, Chwele – Western Kenya</strong></p>
<p>The government has placed severe restrictions on the country and the school was initially closed. As a result of the government regulations Crown City School could not keep the 34 orphans in one place, so 6 families from the Chwele Christadelphians have each taken in five children. We helped provide all basic needs to these children including balanced meals, sanitised soap and medication.</p>
<p>The school has now reopened with grades 4 &amp; 8 students in school including 29 boarders. Crown City school was one of the first schools in the areas to be inspected, and the inspectors were impressed by the organisation of the school and the 10 water points set up on the school site.</p>
<p>CMaD fundraising has been used to provide a new solar water pump and additional latrines for the ecclesial hall (next door to the school site), enabling some classes to take place at the ecclesial hall. Other grades will return next term. Those children without families are still living with local brothers and sisters. This means the need continues to provide additional food to those not at school. As well as providing additional food, funds have also been used provide mattresses, soap and masks.</p>
<p>Joshua took over the running of the school and orphanage when his son Titus died a couple of years ago. Joshua is over 70 years of age and the county doctor has advised all older people to stay in their homes and isolate themselves. His son Amos and daughter Tryphosa are overseeing arrangements for the children.  (<a href="https://vimeo.com/351661890">see o</a><a href="https://vimeo.com/351661890">ur Crown City 2019 film here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Monrovia Academy – Liberia</strong></p>
<p>Liberia has declared a National Health Emergency and has closed schools and all gatherings of over 10 people for 21 days. The Monrovia Academy is a day school in a busy industrial suburb of the capital city and the project is closed until further notice. Children were not living at the project so they are staying home with their families.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Talia School – Sierre Leone</strong></p>
<p>The country has not yet had a case of COVID-19,  is doing all that it can to prevent it entering the country, and has announced a National State of Emergency. The main testing centre for the country only has 370 test kits and 36 isolation beds. The Talia school is in a rural area and is still open and continuing as normal. An order to close is expected soon.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Streetkids – Sierra Leone</strong></p>
<p>Streetkids is based in Freetown and feeds and schools 45 very poor children. Similar welfare precautions are being taken as during the Ebola outbreak and monitoring and supervision will continue to the homes of the children. The government has now announced a year-long State of Emergency and we will see what restrictions are imposed in the coming days.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Benakuma and Mbengwi – Cameroon</strong></p>
<p>These projects have been mothballed for nearly two years due to the civil war that is raging in the country. We have been providing some food aid, but that is now much harder to execute given the coronavirus restrictions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>A Final Thought</strong></p>
<p>Obviously there are many children whose lives have been turned upside down as a result of this virus. Many have had to leave the place they call home to go and live with distant relatives. The photo at the top of this section is startling as you can see the fear and sadness in their eyes. Please pray for all of the children and workers in our projects at this distressing time.</p>

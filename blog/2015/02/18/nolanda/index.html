<p>Groups of children, aged between 4 and 18 years old, are walking between their classes at school. The same snapshot could probably be found millions of times across the world, but if you look closer, something special is happening here. What stands out is that most of the children are either physically disabled, in wheelchairs or on crutches, or have a learning disability. I am at the Nalondo CBM School for the Physically Disabled, one of the largest projects that Meal a Day sponsors. It is one of the most uplifting places I have ever visited.</p>
<p>Traditional African culture refuses to accept disabled children, so even the youngest of these kids has to be brave and tough. The motto of the school completely opposes the traditional culture with the phrase ‘Disability is NOT inability’ painted above a huge Meal a Day mural near the entrance. The mural itself illustrates the support given by Meal a Day for more than 230 children with disabilities here who are fed three meals a day, educated and given a place to call home. Special care is given to suit each child’s needs. Achievements at the school are high and it performs well in regional and national sports and music competitions.</p>
<p>From little more than a mud hut and a handful of unwanted children 16 years ago, Nalondo School has been transformed. Today it boasts an ECD (Early Child Development) class of 59, a Primary School of 211 and a Secondary School of 174 students. The best illustration of how far the school has developed since Meal a Day has been funding it is the provision of wheelchairs. When the project first began, those who were unable to walk were simply carried from one place to another and sat on the floor when they had reached their destination. Now, the 41 children who require a wheelchair have one of their own and are supported by a fully trained healthcare team – an onsite physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and wheelchair handy man!</p>
<p>For me, the most emotional experience of this visit is Annsheillah’s new legs. Less than a year ago Annsheillah had both legs amputated above the knee after a motor accident, which left her seemingly without hope of an education. She is now standing in front of me with a beaming smile as she tests her new prosthetic legs for the first time. Not only has Nalondo given Annsheillah new legs, but it has given her a new hope. Next year she will sit her KCSE (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education), and hopes to achieve the grades required to attend university. I’d hate to think where Annsheillah would be without Nalondo. The school has given her more than just an education and mobility, it’s given her independence, hope, confidence and a future.</p>

<p>The Timboni Children’s home has been running for over 20 years and has grown to be the largest of CMaD’s projects.<br>
The project started on the site of a small holding for goats which had been established in 1989. It functioned well as a source of income for the local community but with an influx of AIDS/HIV in the area in the mid 90s, there became a need to care for children who had lost parents. CMaD supported the local community in the construction of a facility to care for around 40 children. Water security soon became a big issue and a number of projects were implemented including the construction of a sand dam in the river bed to produce a reservoir of subterranean water in the dry season.<br>
Since then, numbers have increased and CMaD has supported construction projects at the local Primary School and the construction of a Secondary School nearby.<br>
The Home now has a number of permanent buildings to care for, feed and accommodate over 100 children and young people between the ages of 5 and 18.  Water is now pumped from the river bed using a wind powered pump providing drinking water and irrigation for the Home’s Farm which produces fruit and vegetables and chickens. There is Kinship Care program at the Home to place children and establish a care programme with extended family where that is the best option. The children in the care of the Home, come from desperately poor families who cannot support their children. Some have been the subject of neglect and abuse and they are provided with love and their everyday physical needs.<br>
CMaD now supports the young people in a Transition Program as they leave Secondary Education and enter adult life, helping them with vocational skills In addition, a teenagers hostel has been built in the grounds allowing 65 young people to attend the new Secondary School</p>
